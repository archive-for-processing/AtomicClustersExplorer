# Atomic Clusters explorer [Processing]

Atomic Clusters is a particle-based simulation inspired by the work **Clusters** from *Jeffrey Ventrella*. I wrote [an article](https://ciphered.xyz/2020/06/01/atomic-clusters,-a-molecular-particle-based-simulation/) to describe both the system and its implementation on my blog. Feel free to check it out if you want an insight on this system.

This simulation is an attraction-repulsion system, where particles can have [0; 4] attractors. Attractors of the same color are attracted, and repelled by attractors of some different colors. These forces generates torque on the particles, creating the angular rotation we can observe.

This tool was made to explore Atomic Clusters with more precision than just throwing random particles all arround. I made a quick video to explain how the tool works:
